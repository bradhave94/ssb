# Super Simple Budget (SSB) - Core Rules

Authoritative spec: `ssd_scope.md`

## Non-negotiables
- Follow the spec exactly; do not invent features.
- Keep the member (wife) experience **stupid simple**.
- Prefer small, safe changes over rewrites.

## Roles
- **Admin**: full control; can approve/clear; can create income; manage templates/envelopes/accounts/settings.
- **Member**: can create **expense** transactions only; always **pending**; cannot clear/approve; cannot manage budgets/accounts.

## Balances & Status
- Continuous accounts (no monthly account reset).
- Only **CLEARED** transactions affect account balances and running balances.
- Pending transactions display as pending and do not affect balances.

## Budgeting
- Overspending allowed (negative remaining).
- Envelope carryover is default **ON** (`carry_over_envelopes` default true) but can be turned off.

## Transfers
- Transfers are implemented as **paired transactions** using `transferPairId`.
- Transfer transactions must have **no envelopeId and no incomeCategoryId**.
