# Member UX Rules

## Quick Add Expense (member)
Keep it minimal:
- Amount (large numeric input, currency formatted)
- Envelope (searchable dropdown, active only)
- Account (defaults to **admin-assigned default account**, not last-used)
- Optional description (collapsible/hidden by default)

**Goal**: Member can add expense in <30 seconds

## Account default
- Always default to admin-set default account for the member
- If >1 account, allow quick toggle (chips/segmented control)
- Never default to "last used" account

## Cleared UI
- Cleared status visible to all
- Cleared toggle interactive only for admin
- Member sees their pending transactions but cannot approve them
